# Castle-Wars
 
 Gist: Medival tower defense
 
 Genre: Tower Defense, Isometric, Casual
 

 Note: 
      The game gives you a three second count down before spawning enemies, and enough gold to place a few turrets. I recommend taking the opportunity to do so. The game will never let you completely block an enemy from accessing the castle. Tip: this placement is a good recommendation to start.
      As you can see, if you are clever and quick, you can make some very complex paths. This can drastically increase your score. The enemies will never stop coming, and each time one is destroyed, a new one will spawn with increased health.
      If you wanna cheat, you can press “C” on the keyboard. This will display the tile coordinates for debug purposes, but also the coordinates will change color indicating where the enemies are likely to go vs. where you are allowed to place a turret.
